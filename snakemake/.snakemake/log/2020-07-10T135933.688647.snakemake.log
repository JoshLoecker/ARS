WildcardError in line 44 of /Users/joshl/PycharmProjects/ARS/snakemake/Snakefile:
Wildcards in params cannot be determined from output files. Note that you have to use a function to deactivate automatic wildcard expansion in params strings, e.g., `lambda wildcards: '{test}'`. Also see https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/rules.html#non-file-parameters-for-rules:
