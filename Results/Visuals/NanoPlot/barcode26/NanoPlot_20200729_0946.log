2020-07-29 09:46:09,951 Nanoplotter: orca not found, not creating static image of html. See https://github.com/plotly/orca
2020-07-29 09:46:09,952 
The orca executable is required to export figures as static images,
but it could not be found on the system path.

Searched for executable 'orca' on the following path:
    /Users/joshl/opt/miniconda3/envs/snakemake/bin
    /Users/joshl/opt/miniconda3/condabin
    /usr/local/bin
    /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin
    /usr/local/bin
    /usr/bin
    /bin
    /usr/sbin
    /sbin

If you haven't installed orca yet, you can do so using conda as follows:

    $ conda install -c plotly plotly-orca

Alternatively, see other installation methods in the orca project README at
https://github.com/plotly/orca

After installation is complete, no further configuration should be needed.

If you have installed orca, then for some reason plotly.py was unable to
locate it. In this case, set the `plotly.io.orca.config.executable`
property to the full path of your orca executable. For example:

    >>> plotly.io.orca.config.executable = '/path/to/orca'

After updating this executable property, try the export operation again.
If it is successful then you may want to save this configuration so that it
will be applied automatically in future sessions. You can do this as follows:

    >>> plotly.io.orca.config.save()

If you're still having trouble, feel free to ask for help on the forums at
